The project extensively analyzes online retail data to understand and predict sales patterns, focusing on consumer behaviors, preferences, and purchasing trends. This analysis involves sophisticated data processing techniques, including cleaning and preprocessing, to ensure data quality. Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to manage the complexity of the data, followed by the application of multiple linear regression and random forest models for predictive analysis. Aditionally, we have used RFM model is particularly emphasized for its utility in customer segmentation, enabling personalized marketing strategies. Through these methodologies, we aim to offer actionable insights for optimizing inventory, refining marketing approaches, and ultimately driving sales growth in the online retail sector.
